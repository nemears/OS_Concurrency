Phase 1:

  A simple way to model this intersection would be with five queues storing
thread indices two locks and two conditional variables. Four of these queues
hold the four directions of threads and the last one controls the threads up
next in their lane to go through the intersection. If a thread is in a
direction queue it waits for the condition that the intersection queue has less
than four memebers and that the thread is at the front of its queue, then it
enqueues on the intersection queue and releases the lock. Once a thread is on
the intersection queue it waits on a condition that it is at the head of the
intersection queue. Then the thread goes through the intersection, and signals
both conditions allowing the threads to progress and releases the second lock.
  This approach is suboptimal because only one thread can go through the
intersection at a time even though there may be the ability for other threads
to through the intersection at the same time.

Phase 2:

  When Massachusetts threads are sent through the intersection they will
deadlock in situations such as,
  1.) Threads from all four directions are not turning right and move to the
  quadrant in front of them before any of them had moved a second tile.
  2.)

My Solution:
  1.) No two threads cannot be in the same quadrant at once because each
  quadrant is defined as a pthread_mutex_t lock that threads have to grab if
  they are going through those quadrants
  2.) The threads wait at the intersection and do not let other threads pass
  them in the intersection because there are four pthread_cond_t variables
  defined for each direction and they wait until the last thread waiting on
  that conditional variable has made it through the intersection.
  3.) My approach improves traffic flow because two cars can go through the
  intersection at once. This is achieved through an ordered acquisition of the
  locks. No matter what order the thread travels through the intersection the
  locks are always gathered in the same order so no thread has a lock another
  thread needs. This allows multiple threads to acquire the locks for the
  quadrants they want and proceed through the intersection.
  4.) The threads print out their indices cardinality direction and new
  cardinality after they get them randomly assigned. Then when they acquire all
  of the locks they need to go through the intersection they print the same
  info. Then after they drop all the locks they say it again.
  5.)
